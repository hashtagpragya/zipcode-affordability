# zipcode-affordability

How do luxury real estate developments in Boston affect housing affordability? What can the data tell us about the ratio of average Bostonians who can afford housing? How effective are the current policies and what additional policy interventions are needed to shift the housing status from a commodity to a fundamental right in Boston's real estate market?

We visualized our analysis using a combination of both reader-driven and author-driven approaches to raise awareness among the general public.
